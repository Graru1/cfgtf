This file provides instructions on how to properly make your TF2 config screenshots.

First of all, download HLAE: http://www.advancedfx.org/download/
Unpack to the folder of your choice (I used /Team Fortress 2 (not /tf!) folder).
Place the contents of the /bench archive in your "Team Fortress 2" folder (again, not /tf, this time this is important). 
Make sure you have your config installed.
Use HLAE.exe to launch your game ("Tools => Developer => Custom Loader"). Make sure you are at 1920x1080 resolution and adjust the recommended dxlevel for your config in launch options. Do not remove "-insecure", it causes the risk of being VAC banned.
Open demoui with Shift+F2 or via any other method and load up the map from "bench_demos" folder. 
Execute "bench_settings".
Execute "bench_mapname", where "mapname" is a name of the map you loaded.  For example, for "itemtest.dem" it is "bench_itemtest".

Use F12 to take screenshots, 'high quality .tgas will be under your /tf/screenshots folder'

Make your screenshots using the following format:

Go to the tick provided (paste in the "tick" field and press "Go")
Press on the provided number on the keyboard. Please notice, that if it says "1 (camera name)", you should press 1 and then make a screenshot, and if it says "1st person spectate X", you don't have to press any keys but you'll have to switch to 1st person spectate mode (otherwise, the viewmodels won't be visible).
Sometimes, to bring up the inspect animations, you'll have to resume and pause the demo again, the tick doesn't have to be exact, but your screen should show (preferably) a killstreak sheen if there is any and an inspect animation.
Particle effects also tend to glitch or speed up while paused from time to time. Simply play/resume the demo to make them look good again.

This demo pack inclues an australium weapon mod that replaces Grenade Launcher with an australium version of it (Valve-way australium textures and materials). Remove it after you're done with screenshots.
If camera shortcuts suddenly stop working, reexecute the config again.
