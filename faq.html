          <p>
		<ul>
        <li>Fill all the necessary information in the forms. Make sure you went through all the tabs before pressing "Generate config" button. Most of the settings are already set for optimal TF2 performance at mid-quality PCs. Every confusing parameter has
          a question mark you can hover on to get a detailed explaination on what it is. </li>
        <li>Press the "Generate config" button. Once finished, your browser will download an archive. Extract it to your "Team Fortress 2/tf" folder. Usually it can be found in something like "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Team Fortress 2\tf".</li>
        <li>Scroll to the bottom of the page and click on white bar with text under "Launch options". Copy that. Right click on TF2 in your Steam Library, press 'Properties' and then 'Launch Options'. Paste given text there. Without this it may not work like
          its supposed to. </li>
        <li>Thats it, you can now play.</li>
      </ul></p>

        <div class="panel-heading" id="why">
          <h3>Why do I need this?</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="panel-body">
          <p>Even though TF2 is an old game, it has gone through so many updates and patches that it is now quite difficult run it at 120+ frames per second on mid-tier PC. And that is absolutely required for playing fast paced shooter comfortably. This app generates a set of premade settings that helps your game to run faster and smoother. </p>

        <div class="panel-heading" id="uninstall">
          <h3>How to uninstall the config?</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="panel-body">
          <p>To completely wipe your game and reset it back to vanilla settings, please follow those steps:</p>
		<p><ul>
        <li>Delete all the files in <code>tf/custom</code> and <code>tf/cfg</code> folder. You can keep the HUD if you have one installed.</li>
        <li><a href="https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=2037-QEUH-3335" target="_blank">Verify your game files using Steam</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=6736-QEIG-8941#enabling" target="_blank">Disable Steam Cloud</a></li>
        <li>Remove everything from your launch options. Paste the following options instead: <code>-novid -default -autoconfig +host_writeconfig +mat_savechanges +quit</code>. Launch the game, it will close itself automatically shortly after.</li>
        <li>Remove all launch options. You are now back to the stock TF2.</li>

        <div class="panel-body">
          <p>Please make sure you have installed it on 100% default, clean TF2 with absolutely <b>no</b> configs and custom files. See the question above.

        <div class="panel-heading" id="outdated">
          <h3>The file/config is outdated.</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="panel-body">
          <p>We try to keep all the stuff up to date, but since there are no static links provided by config authors, all the files have to be updated manually so there may be a delay. Feel free to inform us if we need to update anything. </p>
        </div>

        <div class="panel-heading" id="custom">
          <h3>Can I put my own settings or binds? How do I do that?</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="panel-body">
          <p>Of course you can. There is a "Custom binds/settings" tab at the end of the generator where you can put any custom commands you like. They will overwrite existing settings so be careful. Also, its good to have a general idea about Source games scripting when doing things like this. </p>
        </div>

        <div class="panel-heading" id="bad_graphics">
          <h3>My TF2 looks like poop. I didn't select the worst config here.</h3></div>
        <div class="panel-body">
          <p>First of all, make sure you are using the launch options provided. Secondly, remember - you will generally always have to sacrifice something to see a performance increase. Or spend a some of money on good PC and play without gfx config at all.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="panel-heading" id="post_install_customize">
          <h3>Where do I change settings after I have installed this?</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="panel-body"><p>Inside your /tf/cfg folder there are going to be several files:</p>
          <p><code>binds.cfg</code> - keyboard mappings</p>
          <p><code>settings.cfg</code> - general TF2 settings like viewmodels, hitsounds, advanced options, etc.</p>
          <p><code>gfx.cfg</code> - the entire graphics config.</p>
          <p><code>network.cfg</code> - network settings.</p>
          <p><code>[class name].cfg</code> - class-specific settings that are automatically applied when you change your class.</p>
          <p>Also, if you want to configure your crosshairs and you have a crosshair switcher installed, check out <code>CROSSHAIRSWITCHER-README.txt</code></p>
