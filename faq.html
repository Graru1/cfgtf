          <p>Even though TF2 is an old game, it has gone through so many updates and patches that it is now quite difficult run it at 120+ frames per second on mid-tier PC. And that is absolutely required for playing fast paced shooter comfortably. This app generates a set of premade settings that helps your game to run faster and smoother. </p>

          <h3>My game controls and binds act werid, some keys are not working.</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="panel-body">
          <p>Please make sure you have installed it on 100% default, clean TF2 with absolutely <b>no</b> configs and custom files. You may also have to disable Steam Cloud as it may restore some old settings. You can wipe all your custom stuff by removing the /cfg and /custom folders from your /tf folder and launching the game with <code>-autoconfig</code> launch option.

          <h3>The file/config is outdated.</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="panel-body">
          <p>We try to keep all the stuff up to date, but since there are no static links provided by config authors, all the files have to be updated manually so there may be a delay. Feel free to inform us if we need to update anything. </p>

        <div class="panel-heading">
          <h3>Can I put my own settings or binds? How do I do that?</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="panel-body">
          <p>Of course you can. There is a "Custom binds/settings" tab at the end of the generator where you can put any custom commands you like. They will overwrite existing settings so be careful. Also, its good to have a general idea about Source games scripting when doing things like this. </p>

          <h3>My TF2 looks like poop. I didn't select the worst config here.</h3></div>
        <div class="panel-body">
          <p>First of all, make sure you are using the launch options provided. Secondly, remember - you will generally always have to sacrifice something to see a performance increase. Or spend a lot of money on good PC and play without gfx config at all.</p>

        <div class="panel-heading">
          <h3>Where do I change settings after I have installed this?</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="panel-body"><p>Inside your /tf/cfg folder there are going to be several files:</p>
          <p><code>binds.cfg</code> - keyboard mappings</p>
          <p><code>settings.cfg</code> - general TF2 settings like viewmodels, hitsounds, etc.</p>
          <p><code>gfx.cfg</code> - the entire graphics config.</p>
          <p>Also, if you want to configure your crosshairs and you have a crosshair switcher installed, check out <code>CROSSHAIRSWITCHER-README.txt</code></p>
