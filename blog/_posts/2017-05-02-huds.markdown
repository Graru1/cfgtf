Here goes a tiny but important update

* HUDs support. We now support several HUDs, more coming up very soon. This feature is in a kind of a beta state, it may slow down the progress bar so don't worry if you don't see a percentage.
* Fixed class changer throwing an error if no crosshair switcher selected
* Added medigun check script
* User input is now being saved, never loose your settings if you close the tab anymore! (may not work flawlessly for some fields). Use "Reset" button to return to defaults.
* Fixed hugs.tf and essentials.tf images pointing towards huds.tf (thanks Llewxamris).
