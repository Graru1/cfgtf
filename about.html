      <h1 class="page-header">About CFG.TF</h1>
      <p> CFG.TF is a free open-source cross-platform Team Fortress 2 config generator. Even if TF2 is an old game, it has gone through so much updates and patches that it is now nearly impossible to make it run at constant 120+ frames per second on mid-tier
        PC. And that is absolutely required for playing fast paced shooter comfortably. Ever dreamed of optimizing your game experience in just a few clicks? Well, here is your chance. This app generates a set of premade settings that helps your game
        to run faster and smoother. </p>
      <h3>How do I use it?</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Fill all the necessary information in the forms. Make sure you went through all the tabs before pressing "Generate config" button. Most of the settings are already set for optimal TF2 performance at mid-quality PCs. Every confusing parameter has
          a question mark you can hover on to get a detailed explaination on what it is. </li>
        <li>Press the "Generate config" button. Once finished, your browser will download an archive. Extract it to your "Team Fortress 2/tf" folder. Usually it can be found in something like "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Team Fortress 2\tf".</li>
        <li>Scroll to the bottom of the page and click on white bar with text under "Launch options". Copy that. Right click on TF2 in your Steam Library, press 'Properties' and then 'Launch Options'. Paste given text there. Without this it may not work like
          its supposed to. </li>
        <li>Thats it, you can now play.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>How it works</h3>
      <p>100% Javascript-powered, it works entirely in your browser. You can even <a href="//github.com/mkrl/cfgtf/archive/master.zip">download</a> it from the GitHub page and run it offline on your computer!</p>
      <p class="text-muted">In order to run a website on your PC, you will require a http server. If you use Node.js on Windows, you can run <code>npm install -g http-server</code> and launch it from server.bat from the project root. Alternatively, just open the relevent index.html file in your browser. make/index.html for client configs, server/index.html for server configs.</p>
      <p>Stuff used:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="//github.com/Stuk/jszip">JSZip</a>, the main core of this app. </li>
        <li><a href="//getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap 3</a>, extremely powerful and simple to use web framework. </li>
        <li>Javascript and <a href="//jquery.com">jQuery</a> for file and form processing. </li>
				<li><a href="//cdnjs.com">cdnjs</a> <abbr title="Free and open-source software">FOSS</abbr> <abbr title="Content Delivery Network">CDN</abbr> for resources. </li>
