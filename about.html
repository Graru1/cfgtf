      <h1 class="page-header">About CFG.TF</h1>
      <p> CFG.TF is a free open-source cross-platform Team Fortress 2 config generator. Even if TF2 is an old game, it has gone through so much updates and patches that it is now nearly impossible to make it run at constant 120+ frames per second on mid-tier
        PC. And that is absolutely required for playing fast paced shooter comfortably. Ever dreamed of optimizing your game experience in just a few clicks? Well, here is your chance. This app generates a set of premade settings that helps your game
        to run faster and smoother. </p>

      <h3>How it works</h3>
      <p>100% Javascript-powered, it works entirely in your browser. You can even <a href="//github.com/mkrl/cfgtf/archive/master.zip">download</a> it from the GitHub page and run it offline on your computer!</p>
      <p class="text-muted">After some time this site has migrated to Jekyll to simplify the development process. In order to run this, you'll have to build the site first. If you are unfamiliar with Jekyll - take a look at this sweet <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/quickstart/">quick start guide</a> </p>
