Hey, everyone! It's been almost a year without any updates, but here is a small portion of fixies for several important things:

* VTF crosshairs for explosive weapons are now being downloaded properly.
* Fixed Demoman callouts being broken in callouts addon.
* Updated nohats mod to the latest Scream Fortress X version (thank you Jeebs).
* Small visual adjustments.


We would also like to announce that we are not able to provide full support and customization level of the original mastercomfig, please consider using the [official site](https://mastercomfig.com/) or [GitHub repository](https://github.com/mastercoms/mastercomfig) instead. The latest supported version is 6.7.0 | April 27 2018. 

Play safe, stay cool!
