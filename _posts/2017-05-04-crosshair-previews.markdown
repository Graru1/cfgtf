Your daily doze of updates:

* Crosshair switcher now has crosshair previews.
* Added a missing option for default crosshairs.
* Option to force graphic features that configs usually let you enable by uncommenting (gibs, facial features, etc)
* More HUDs, very easy and fine looking previews.
* Improved visuals and performance.
* Fixed several typos, improved some text.
* The main page is now slightly more fancy.
* Saving feature is disabled now, it was too buggy, might be back in another form later.
