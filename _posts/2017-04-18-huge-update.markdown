Our first rather huge site update:



### Thanks to xiyzzc for contributing:


* The footer was reworked with proper bootstrap columns so that its responsive on small screens
* Slight frontpage rework
* Config preview rework. Configs currently have a slideshow of 5 pl_badwater images, and pros/cons are 2 columns underneath.
* Added Felik's "Low End", "Eye Candy" configs
* Config images are lazy loaded with unveil.js so that the user doesn't download them all at once. Loading triggers from the dropdown selection. - Minor text rework
* Fixed a bug when Firefox users could not generate configs with hitsound files included


### Funtionality improvements 2.2:


* Added a binds section where you can easily manage your key settings / added an option to NOT bind anything for other than QWERTY keyboard users
* Added CastingEssentials addon
* Added an option to set up a toggle bind for viewmodels
* Added an option to use left-handed viewmodels
* Added a small config database
* You can now select minimal viewmodels for specific weapons in crosshair switcher settings

### Minor fixies:


* Fixed broken slider
* Improved shadows on the landing page
* Removed duplicate hitsound
* Polished desctiptions for some settings, added compatibility notices
